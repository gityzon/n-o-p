### Warning:
#### This repo has a secure problem as conf.json is right,but your database could be download.
#### I've tried to fix,but made no sense.(Plenty of commits!)
#### One possible way is to replace nginx with apache as http server,but it's diffucult on replit.
#### Maybe when I have enough time,I'll do the things to right.Yet,any PR is welcome.Thanks!
